/**
 * Stage 3 task §6/§9. Action rules, derived directly from the Stage 2
 * contract (src/lib/onboarding/progress.ts), never invented separately:
 * - COMPLETE / NOT_APPLICABLE: no button (§9).
 * - NOT_STARTED, blocked (`actionable: false`): show `blockedReason`
 *   instead of the normal description; no buttons — skip is still offered
 *   if `skippable`, matching the Stage 2 skip action's own contract (it has
 *   no dependency check).
 * - NOT_STARTED, actionable: a "Go to" link when `targetHref` exists, and a
 *   "Skip" button when `skippable` — independent, both can show together.
 * - SKIPPED: no button. Un-skipping only ever happens by doing the real
 *   thing elsewhere in the app (§9's "stale row is harmless dead data"
 *   stance) — this card has nothing to un-skip it with directly.
 * WELCOME/FINISH naturally get no action button: both have `targetHref:
 * null` and `skippable: false`, so the two conditions above simply never
 * trigger for them — no special-casing needed.

          and blocked-reason text, which pushed the description
          (text-gray-500) to ~2.3:1 contrast, under WCAG AA's 4.5:1
          minimum for normal text — see step-row-actions.ts's own comment.

              keyboard user lost all visual track of where focus landed.
              Plain `focus:` (not `focus-visible:`) is deliberate: this
              element is never part of the natural tab order (tabIndex=-1,
              only ever focused programmatically), so there's no "ring
              after a mouse click" case to avoid — using `:focus-visible`
              here would depend on browser/automation heuristics for
              programmatic focus that aren't guaranteed consistent, where
              plain `:focus` always matches deterministically whenever
              `.focus()` is called. */}
