 * Stage 7.1.1 (Workspace Completion Experience). A pure presentation-layer
 * summary derived entirely from the existing Stage 2 progress contract
 * (src/lib/onboarding/progress.ts) — no new Prisma query, no new
 * persisted state, no change to how a step's status is computed. Mirrors
 * how step-row-actions.ts/should-render-card.ts already extract pure,
 * unit-testable view logic out of the components themselves rather than
 * inventing a second onboarding data source.
 *
 * The customer-facing headline/subheadline are intentionally the two
 * fixed strings this stage's own task specified — not tiered by percent —
 * since the card (OnboardingCard, via shouldRenderOnboardingCard) is only
 * ever visible while genuinely incomplete; "almost ready" holds at any
 * point along that range, and the percent number itself (already shown by
 * OnboardingProgressBar) is what conveys exactly how far along.
