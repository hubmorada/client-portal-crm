/**
 * Stage 7.1.1. Purely additive to OnboardingCard — no new interactive
 * elements (no new links/buttons), so there is nothing here for a Skip/Go
 * to click to duplicate or conflict with the existing per-step rows below.
 * Deliberately plain, single-text-node paragraphs — never a `<ul>`/`<li>`
 * (OnboardingCard's own step list is the one accessible "list" this card
 * exposes; test/e2e/onboarding-ui.spec.ts asserts exactly 11 listitems),
 * and never a nested `<span>` splitting the "label:" prefix from its own
 * content (a nested element would give text-matching queries like
 * `getByText(/^Up next:/)` two overlapping candidates — the prefix span
 * and the whole paragraph — for a single logical line). Joining each set
 * of step labels into one sentence also means a step's own bare label is
 * never a second, ambiguous exact-text match for an assertion targeting
 * that step's real row below.
