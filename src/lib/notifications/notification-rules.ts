 * Raw IDs needed to resolve a Notification's recipient(s) — never persisted
 * to Activity.metadata (which only ever holds human-readable names/emails,
 * see src/lib/activity/*-metadata.ts) and never rendered anywhere itself.
 * previousOwnerId is kept for documentation even though, in every current
 * OWNERSHIP_TRANSFERRED code path, it always equals the actor and is
 * therefore dropped by the universal actor-exclusion rule in
 * dispatch-notifications.ts.
 *
 * mentionedUserIds (Comments & Mentions Stage 3): already fully validated
 * by the caller before createActivity is ever invoked — real users, real
 * current Membership in this Activity's own organizationId, actor already
 * excluded, deduped, capped at MAX_MENTIONS_PER_COMMENT (src/lib/comments/
 * mentions.ts). For a create, this is every valid mention in the comment;
 * for an edit, only the newly-added ones (src/lib/comments §5/§7) — never
 * removed or unchanged mentions, which must never re-notify.
 *
 * parentEntityId (Comments & Mentions Stage 4): the Project/Task id a
 * MENTIONED comment belongs to — resolveCommentTarget's already-verified
 * result, never a client-supplied value. Exists solely so MENTIONED's own
 * buildMetadata can carry it into the Notification's metadata for deep-
 * linking; deliberately never written to Activity.metadata (see comment-
 * metadata.ts's own "never IDs" discipline, which this doesn't change).
