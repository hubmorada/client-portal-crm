 * or a pre-rendered string; a future UI component maps over these and
 * renders each with ordinary JSX text nodes (and a fixed `<MentionTag>`-
 * style component for `mention` segments) — nothing here ever produces
 * markup, so this feature never needs React's raw-HTML-injection escape
 * hatch, matching this app's project-wide invariant against using it.
 *
 * A token only becomes a `mention` segment if its userId is in
 * `validMentionUserIds` — the *actually persisted* CommentMention rows for
 * this exact comment, passed in by the caller (never re-derived by
 * trusting the parsed text alone). A well-formed-looking token whose
 * userId was never a valid org member at write time (or was removed by a
 * later edit) renders as plain literal text, identical treatment to a
 * malformed token — "current valid Mention rows only" (§12), not "anything
 * that parses."
